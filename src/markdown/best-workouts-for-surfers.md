<!---Best Workouts for Surfers
There are a couple different types of workouts you can do to improve your surfing: Body weight exercises, Swimming workouts (in a lap pool), Paddling workouts and Yoga/Flexibility workouts.

Body weight exercises are good if you are stuck at home during quarantining and you want something to do to keep in shape when you can get back in the water.

The swimming workout mentioned in this blog post is good for getting ready for better breath holding and big wave surfing.

The paddling workout will help you paddle into waves better and possibly catch more waves, I believe that working on your padding is the most beneficial to you as a surf as it will help you get more waves.

Yoga and Flexibility workouts will be additionally helpful as they will allow you to be able to use your body better when trying to do bigger better mauvers. If you ever see people in surfing magazines doing something crazy, they are always in some crazy pretzel like shape that requires some flexibility.

Body Weight Exercises
Surfing is a whole body experience, so the body weight exercise is a full body, body weight exercise.

Here is the workout:
Legs 4 set
Split Leg Squats 6 reps
Squat Jumps 5 reps
Dynamic Lunge 10 reps (each leg)
Arms 3 sets
Ring Chin Ups (or regular chinups) 5 reps
Pushups 20 reps
Band rotations 10 reps on each arm
Core 3 sets
Jack Knife 5 reps
Deadbug 7-10 reps

Here is a description of why we do each one:

Split Leg Squats: they help hip strength and flexibility
Squat Jumps: Improve squat strength, bottom turn, carves
Dynamic Lunge: hip strength and flexibility, fit into those barrels, carves,
Ring Chin Ups/Chin Ups:  Shoulder Strength, better paddling
Pushups: chest strength, better paddling, get up, duck dive
Band Rotations: arm strength, core strength, paddling
Jack Knife: Duck Dive
Deadbug: everything

Swimming Workout
Swimming is very similar to paddleing, and can help you become a better paddler. This workout will also help you have better breath control and allow you to remain calm while taking big sets on the head.

The Workout:
4 sets
    150 meter swim
What you do: swim at an endurance pace, then when you hit the wall, do a flip turn and swim as far as you can under water, then continue swimming and repeat.

Paddling Workout
Paddling is a large part of surfing, and what's the best way to improve your padding? Paddling. If you can this is probably the best way to workout your arms to be a better paddler!!

The Workout:

2 x 100 yards at a brisk but comfortable pace (endurance).
3 x 50 yards at a faster pace than the previous set, with 10 pushups after each 50 yard effort (strength).
4 x 25 yards all out (power).
Rest for 15 to 20 seconds between each effort. Rest for 2 minutes before repeating a second round.

Upward facing dog
Pigeon pose

Extended side pose
