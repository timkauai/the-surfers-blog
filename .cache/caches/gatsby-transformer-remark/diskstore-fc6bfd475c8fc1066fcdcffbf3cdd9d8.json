Backside has many differences from the frontside, but also many advantages.</p>\n<p>Before you start\nYou want to make sure you have the backside snap and backside carves down, not knowing how to do these will hurt you in the long run, but its still possible to learn if you aren’t 100% confident with those yet.</p>\n<p>Speed. Speed. Speed.\nWhen you start on the wave and decide you want to do a backside air, the more important thing you can do is gain speed! </p>\n<p>Find the right foot placement and section to do it, but it is important to gain a bunch of speed before you attempt to go for the air</p>\n<p>Timing\nFrom there it is all about timing and when you try to hit the lip. It is important that you do it when the lip is steep and about to crumble, because otherwise you might not land back on the wave!</p>\n<p>Hitting the lip\nDepending on how much speed you have, do a bottom turn to end up on the lip</p>\n<p>Once you are there, try to throw your arm up to space to get your weight distribution correct. Additionally while you are doing this try to turn your board in mid air, to land back on the wave after you finish the maneuver</p>\n<p>Landing\nIt is quite hard to change how/where you land, but it is important to try not to land on the flats, or before the wave.</p>\n<p>The ideal place to land in on the already crumbled, white wash of the wave.</p>\n<p>Tips\nMake sure the wind is correct when doing the air. If the wind is wrong, the board will either hit you in face or go flying away from you.\nDoing a grab when going backwards forces you to bend your knees and looks cleaner.\nAlso, don’t forget to commit. Many people can launch just fine, but just can’t commit in the right way, and completely mess the whole maneuver up</p>\n<p>Watch the video, it explains it much better</p>"}
