I am rather an avid surfer who also watches surf movies in my freetime. I figured, due to my vast knowledge on surf films, I would recommend some to you, as you are probably looking for something to watch right now.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":261,"offset":285}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>The Endless Summer</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic right\">\n<div class=\"7BS-endless-summer pic left\"></div>\nTo begin with the best, I would probably consider this the most iconic surf movie of all time. It all started with the search for the perfect wave, and it grew to something so much bigger. I grew up watching this film and getting motivation to go explore every peak I know. It's so hard to give it so much praise without spoiling anything, but this is the best surf movie I have ever watched, I hope to one day go on my own endless summer. The cinematography is good for the time it was filmed in, and I believe that this film will forever be a classic in the land of surf movies. If you haven’t watched it, I 100% recommend it.\n</div>\n<h3>10/10</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":287},"end":{"line":10,"column":15,"offset":1043}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>Stab in the Dark (All of them)</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\">\n<div class=\"7BS-stab pic right\"></div>\nStab in the dark isn’t your typical surf movie or surf documentary, rather it is a sort of experiment. Stab, an amazing Surf magazine (go check them out), put on this event where they get a popular famous surfer to review surfboards from the world's biggest and most popular shapers. BUT, there is a catch, the Pros don’t know what board they are riding and get to pick their favorite board without knowing whose board it is. Additionally, the shapers don’t know who they are shaping the board for! It is quite an interesting experiment. They bring in new surfers every year. AND its free!! I think my ranking is: 1 - Jordy Smith, 2 - Mick, 3 - All Stars, 4 - Dane, 5 - Julian.\n</div>\n2016: Julian Wilson\n2017: Dane Reynolds\n2018: Jordy Smith\n2019: Mick Fanning\n2020: All Stars ( Surfers from past 3 years come together )","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1045},"end":{"line":21,"column":60,"offset":1974}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h3>AVG: 9.5/10</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1,"offset":1976},"end":{"line":23,"column":21,"offset":1996}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>View from a Blue Moon</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic right\">\n<div class=\"7BS-blue-moon pic left\"></div>\nThe best cinematography of any surf film I have ever seen. If you are about to go on a surf sesh, this John John film will definitely get you ready to shred. It's hard not to want to go surfing after such a great surf film. John John’s skill makes the movie so good, but so does the cinematography and the adventure.\nAdditionally, If you want to watch more films somewhat like it check out John John’s Youtube, and watch his multiple part videos such as Twelve and Vela, they are amazing and give off the same vibes as View from a Blue Moon.\n</div>\n<h3>9/10<h3>","position":{"start":{"line":25,"column":1,"offset":1998},"end":{"line":31,"column":13,"offset":2663}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>Momentum Generation</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\">\n<div class=\"7BS-blue-moon pic right\"></div>\nA great movie about how the best surfers in the world came to be. All growing up in the same house right on shore from the world's best wave, pipeline. It is quite a crazy story and makes you really think how do heroes like Kelly and Machado come to be so good! It is a great movie about some of the greatest times in surfing history.\n</div>\n<h3>9/10</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":33,"column":1,"offset":2665},"end":{"line":38,"column":14,"offset":3122}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>Kissed By God</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic right\">\n<div class=\"7BS-blue-moon pic left\"></div>\nSimilar to Momentum Generation, this movie tells how one of the world's best surfers, Andy Irons, got caught up in the worst part of the sport, Drugs and Alcohol and how it all ended up for him. I am a bit biased because I grew up surfing the same wave that Andy surfed, and he is a legend in my hometown, however kissed by god is truly one of the best surf movies I have watched!\n</div>\n<h3>9/10</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":40,"column":1,"offset":3124},"end":{"line":45,"column":14,"offset":3621}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>Chasing Mavericks</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic left\">\n<div class=\"7BS-blue-moon pic right\"></div>\nThis is the kind of story that only a surfer would understand. There is a specific moment in the movie which only a surfer would understand, the decision of whether or not to go out. The story not only talks about Surfing, but also about love, and facing your fears. Seperate from some of the other movies on the list, this movie is more than about surfing and has a great plot to it!\n</div>\n<h3>8.5/10</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":47,"column":1,"offset":3623},"end":{"line":52,"column":16,"offset":4130}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h2>The Endless Summer II</h2>\n<div class=\"tip-w-pic right\">\n<div class=\"7BS-blue-moon pic left\"></div>\nThe sequel to Endless Summer.
