Something bout it being a pipe makes it so special\nPushing Challenger season, is there gonna me something new in that...who knows seems quite interesting!! Should be fun to be able to watch pretty much year round!!\nMid season cut off makes it seem like play offs should be interesting! What about those injured...like john john\n\nAll around, I love it and I hope that it gets good\n\nTop Picks\nJohn John - Back from injury, good season last year pre injury\nKolohe - working hard since last season, looks really good!\nJordy - Strong season last year, can he push thru?\nItalo - tons of news from him, hopefully his energy can keep up and he can take one by the horns\n\n\nWho has an advantage during this pandemic?\nSurfers who frequently travel and expect that travel and use it as training are at an extreme disadvantage this year. Additionally, those who live inland and live in a strict country not allowing surfing are at a much worse disadvantage and canâ€™t surf. As well as, those who live near one of the stops on the pro tour. \nThis will definitely change between now and when the tour starts so check back in November/December!!--->","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":106,"offset":1300}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<h3>coming soon...our team of writers are working hard to bring this to you ASAP</h3>","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":1302},"end":{"line":22,"column":86,"offset":1387}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":23,"column":1,"offset":1388}}}}
